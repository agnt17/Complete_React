Before learning react we have to understand all the basics.

//npm: node package manager
//npx: node package executer

now basically whenever we install nodeJS in our system then what usually happens is that node installs few utilities and dependencies which can be used on various occassions. Sometimes when we are creating good projects then we need to install few extra node packages so that our work became very handy as we can use them directly.

Now to install them we use npm or npx, so npm installs all the files and then use them while npx doesnt installs all files instead it does what that it executes directly the required file.

************************\*\*************************How to create a react project**********************\*\*\*\***********************

We can do it in various ways

1: npx create-react-app appName --------> Now u should not use this it is a slow one and takes a lot of time to install all the dependencies because it also contains a lot of files that are not even needed most of the times.

2: npm create vite@latest: This is a better option to perform as this is less bulky and vite provide us a good way to install packages and use them.But the problem here is that there is no node_modules folder here which u can install by just firing npm install or npm i.

Now the package.json file contains all the dependencies and all extra things in it.

To run the project we can use both npm run or npm run start.... but it is advised to use npm run dev cause npm start has few exceptions.

Hooks in react:

Hooks are basically the functions that return two values in the form of an array means u can thought hooks as a function...a simple function which return 2 values in form of arrays.. 1st is the variable and 2nd is the function related to that variable. That is why we say

"const [var, function_related_to_var] = hookname(initial value)"

//usestate hook: It is used to propogate the changes to the UI that are done to a variable by various functions. Basically repainitng the UI. We learn this first when we try to repaint the UI in counter_project by increasing or decreasing value.

usestate gives two things in form of an array...and in return we can write any value inside the useState(--here--) parenthesis it may be any value like empty string, empty object, number etc...now lets talk about two things....first one is a variable and second one is function

ex:
let [any_variable , setAny_variable] = useState(Any_item);

    now this hook will update all the instances of any_variable and  u have to write how u want to change any_variable by calling the setAny_variable function.

Props in react: So basically props are used to reuse the components again and again. In react we dont segregate different things on the basis of their technology used but instead we make components of every item and then w can reuse it again.
Basically props are used to pass components from parent component to child component.
Parent-Child Communication:
React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that data flows from a parent component down to its child components. The parent component can pass data (props) to its children, and these props are then accessible in the child component.

    suppose a situation that we are using a card container and we want similar 10 cards like we see on amazon and flipkart sites.
    So what we basically do is that we will create 1 card component and then we will use that card component again and again and pass a array like structure to change the values inside the card.

//useRef Hook: UseRef hook is used when we are going to take the reference of anything.

************************\*************************CAN WE CREATE A CUSTOM HOOK**********************\*\*\*\***********************

Yes ofcourse we can create a custom hook, after all hook is a fucntin that returns the array so yeah why not we can create hooks

eg:
function use*hookname*(variable){
return [];
}

This is how we create a custom hook

**********************\*\*\*\***********************React Router********************\*\*\*\*********************

// React Router: React router is a popular library for handling navigation and routing react. Basically it allows users to create SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS[SPA] with multiple views or components that can be displayed based on application URL.Means vo jo reloading wala scenario tha na ki reload nhi hota sare components main page se hi connect hote hai....ha ha whi react router ki help se ho pata hai.

But in sb ke liye hume to ek route pehle bnana padega. To ha what we do now is that we will create a route then mount other pages to it...

Now we will create an Layout.jsx file and in this file we will just put that components names into that file directly and these components are not gonna change for any page instead only the Outlet component pages will change. Just visit Layout.jsx in project 8 of react router u will get what is written here.

To take out any function data from any fetch we have to create a function and then we have to use useEffect hook to fetch the data from an API and store that data to some variable then we can easily fetch data from that variable using dot notation.....Github.jsx file in project 8 to understand it more clearly.

//********************\*\*********************Context API********************\*\*\*********************

Props Drilling: Now suppose we want to pass the data from the app component to any child component but that child is child of anyother component which may be child of any other component eventually app is parent of final component so here app is not the direct parent to children due to this, we have to pass data to each hierarchial children eventhough they dont even need that data...thus passing component data to each children even they dont want but they have to become a medium so that data can be easily passed to the required children. This process is called prop drilling.

Now this also decreases the efficiency of the app thus we need a concept where all data can be stored in a file and then any children can directly access that fil this is the concept of CONTEXT API.

But what is actually context:
Imagine you have a magic bag (context) that contains a special item (data) that many people (components) in different rooms (parts of your app) want to use. Instead of handing the item from one person to the next, you leave the magic bag in a central location. Anyone who needs the item can just reach into the bag and take it.

In React terms:

Magic Bag (Context): Holds the data.
Special Item (Data): The information you want to share.
People (Components): Different parts of your app that need access to the information.

Now whatever component needs a particular set of data from a particular context then we need to wrap that components into the context of that component. 
eg: Login, Profile needs the details of user and we made a UserContext.js file that stores the data that is required by Login and profile so what we do is we will wrap these into UserContext....somewhat like: Since all the context are also provider that provides the required data. 

<UserContext>
    <Login/>
    <Profile/>
</UserContext>

useContext in react: In React, the useContext Hook is used to consume the value of a context. It provides a way for functional components to access the value that a Provider higher up in the component tree provides.



**********************************************REDUX TOOLKIT***********************************************
ab tk jo hm kr rhe the means components bnate the data pass krte the through props and all but u know things are not so much maintained and aap jb react app ka code dekhnge tb aapko lgega that it is mostly messed up so ab kya kre???

So what we basically do here is we create our app using redux library, now it is not inly created for react js it is created for other js apps also, before this we have flux but wee dont need to learn that we will not even learn redux instead we learn a more organised part of redux that is redux-toolkit. Now this is more organised and well suited for creating apps.

**********process of how this work:

Imagine your application's data (state) is like a big, centralized storage unit.

State: This storage unit holds all the important information about your app â€“ like user data, settings, and anything that changes while people use your app.

Actions: Actions are like messages that tell the storage unit something happened. For example, if a user clicks a button, an action is sent to the storage unit saying, "Hey, the button was clicked!"

Reducers: Reducers are the workers in charge of updating the storage unit based on the actions they receive. They decide how the data in the storage unit should change.

Store: The store is the actual storage unit. It keeps the current state of your app and lets you send actions to update that state.



//*************************************Environment Variables***********************************

some variables are need not to be showed, since it is frontend whatever u pass is a javascript which could be fetched easily and due to which we need to protect it thus we store them in env files to save them from exposing and also these env files are only form parallel to root directory.
